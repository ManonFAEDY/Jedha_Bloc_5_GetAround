# ðŸš— GetAround: Rental Time Optimization and Pricing

This project, carried out as part of a partnership with GetAround (the "Airbnb for cars"), is divided into two parts:

1.  **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Creation of a dashboard to help product management optimize rental logistics.
2.  **Machine Learning and API**: Development of a daily price prediction endpoint for car owners.

## 1\. ðŸ“Š Data Analysis & Visualization (Streamlit Web Dashboard)

The main objective is to provide factual insights to determine the best strategy for the **minimum delay between two rentals** to reduce customer dissatisfaction caused by late returns, while minimizing potential revenue loss.

The interactive dashboard is built with **Streamlit** and addresses key product management questions regarding the **threshold** (minimum delay duration) and the **scope** (all cars vs. Connect cars only).

### Dashboard Features

  * **Time Delta Analysis**: Visualization of the distribution of time elapsed between two consecutive rentals, with filters to simulate the impact of a minimum delay.
  * **Previous Delay Impact**: Study of the correlation between the delay of the previous rental and the status of the following rental (`successful` or `failed`), segmented by check-in type (`mobile` or `connect`).
  * **Key Metrics**: Display of the percentages of potentially affected rentals to help find the right balance between improving user experience and optimizing revenue.

  * **Framework**: Streamlit
  * **Data Analysis/Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
  * **Visualization**: Plotly Express

## 2\. ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & API

This section focuses on optimizing daily pricing for owners, using a Machine Learning model trained on vehicle pricing data.

A notebook is provided to show the preparation of the model used in the API.

The model is exposed via an API to allow its integration into production systems.

### /predict Endpoint

The API is hosted online and provides a `/predict` endpoint that allows submitting a vehicle's characteristics (model, mileage, power, options, etc.) and receiving an estimated daily rental price.
